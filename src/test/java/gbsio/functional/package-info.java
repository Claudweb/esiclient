/**
 * Contains functional tests for the ESI client.
 * <p>
 * These tests are very fragile, and rely on specific, privileged API
 * credentials that will not be distributed. Some tests also rely on specific
 * testing scenarios in-game, such as being the boss of a fleet at the moment of
 * test execution. As such, they likely won't be of much use to developers
 * working on the client without significant alteration or care.
